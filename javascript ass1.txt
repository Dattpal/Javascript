
1. Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)
Ans:-JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted,    full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.
-JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side?
Ans:- Client-side:
		Does not need interaction with the server
		Runs on the user’s computer
		Reduces load on the server’s proccessing unit
		Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Server-side:
		Requires interaction with the server
		Runs on the web server
		Allows the server to provide dynamic websites tailored to the user. Increases the processing load on server.
		Languages used: PHP, ASP.net, Python

3. What is Nodejs?
Ans:-Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

4. Explain Scope in JavaScript
Ans:-Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.

5. JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.
Ans:- Javascript is Synchronous, It is a synchronous, single-threaded language. Because it has a single thread that's why it can only execute one command at a time and the other commands need to wait for executing before the running command executes. And the term synchronous means one at a time.

6. JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.
Ans:- JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, it can be really easy to implement as we don't have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like a deadlock. Since JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it is synchronous in nature.

7. Explain DOM in your own word.
Ans:- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
